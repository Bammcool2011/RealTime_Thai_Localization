# Real Time [![Steam Downloads](https://img.shields.io/steam/downloads/1420955187.svg?label=Steam%20downloads&logo=steam)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1420955187)

A mod for the Cities: Skylines game. Adjusts the time flow in the game to make it more real.
**Real Time** makes the game way more real and more challenging!

## Key Features
### Time flow

- The game time flows slowly. The time speed can be configured for the daytime and for the night time separately.
- The sunrise and the sunset times depend on the map location and on the day of year.
- Citizens grow up slower. 1 in-game day equals to 1 citizen's year. Citizens live up to 85 years, so with Real Time - up to 85 in-game days.
- Slower aging changes the education system: a child needs 5 in-game days to graduate from an elementary school and become a teen. A teen needs 10 in-game days to graduate from a high school and become a young adult. Finally, a student needs another 5 in-game days to get the highest education level.

### Work...

- The adult citizens go to work in the morning. The children go to school.
- There are weekends. No school, no usual work on weekends!
- The adults may also work second shift, night shift, and some of them work on weekends!
- A lot of traffic, especially at rush hour times.
- Citizens can go out for lunch, if there are some commercial buildings near the citizens' workplaces.
- Citizen can go on vacation for some days. Families prefer to go on vacation all together (parents and children).

### ...and relax

- The school ends earlier, so the children can have spare time.
- After work or school, the citizens go shopping or relaxing.
- Children stay at home in the late evening.
- Citizens can attend events like football matches. In addition to the game events, there are some other events for various unique buildings in the city.
- Tourists can stay in the city for longer, if there are some hotels.
- In the night time, no one will visit parks; a single exception: the 'Night tours' policy is activate in a park.
- Only few citizens will go out and party at night (in leisure buildings, if there are any). 
- Some adult citizens will take night shopping tours.

### More real

- Citizens might go shopping even when they don't need any goods - just for fun.
- Tourists also prefer to sleep at night.
- The buildings will be constructed slowly.
- There are restrictions how many construction sites are allowed at the same time in the city.
- The building construction sites pause at night.
- Citizens switch the lights off when they are going to sleep, as well as many other parks and buildings.
- When the weather becomes bad, citizens try to shelter from the weather in the buildings.
- Citizens remember how long they need to get to work and use this in their schedules, trying to be on-time.
- When waiting for public transport for too long or stuck in a traffic jam, citizens get angry and cancel their journeys.

## Performance note
**Real Time** works best with medium-sized cities (population up to 65.500). With large cities, there are some game limitations that make it difficult for **Real Time** to keep the citizens behavior realistic. Furthermore, the CPU usage and the graphic adapter load increase drastically, because every citizen needs to be precisely simulated.
